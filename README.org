#+title: Dactyl Generator Demo

[[file:README.zh.org][中文版]]

[[https://dactyl.mbugert.de/][Dactyl Generator]] is a website to generate 3D model in form of scad file for
dactyl keyboard case. This project dactyl-generator-demo is a Java program which shows how the
parameters work by generating models and preview images using [[https://dactyl.mbugert.de/api][Dactyl Generator API]].
It helps you adjust the parameters.
Currently only dactyl manuform is demonstrated.

The curvature and tenting are measured in radian. PI radian is equal to 180 degree. PI/180 is equal to 1 degree.

The original [[https://dactyl.siskam.link][Dactyl Generator]] website was [[https://github.com/ibnuda/dactyl-keyboard/issues/116][reported]] to be down on 2022-06-23.

* Base
  This is a base model for comparison. Most of parameters use the default value.
  Those non-default values are specified in form of (+default value+ used value).
  The combination of (number of columns: 6, last row key counts: use all keys)
  helps demo the effect of param ~hide bottom pinky~.
  If param ~height offset~ is set to default value 4mm, the demo model of some
  parameters is broken, so it's set to 10mm.

* Keys

** Thumb key count
   2, 3, 3-mini, 4, 5, 6 in order

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+x-DIAGONAL-cmp.png]]

** Last row key counts
   "no last row" vs "use all keys"

   column 3 to 6 have 3 rows

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(keys.last-row=0)-TOP-cmp.png]]

   two vs "use all keys"

   column 5 and 6 have 3 rows

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(keys.last-row=2)-TOP-cmp.png]]

** Key hole

   [[file:images/mx-vs-box.png]]

   Cherry switch and Gateron switch are MX switch, which have a notch.
   Outemu switch is similar to Kailh Box switch.
   TTC switch is MX switch.

   MX vs "Box and MX"

   Additional nub which is stuck in the MX switch notch. Without the nub, hot glue is required.

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(keys.switch-type=mx)-BOTTOM_DIST_200-cmp.png]]

   "MX snap-in" vs MX

   Notice the space under the nub, which helps nub firmly snap in the switch notch.
   I personally prefer MX snap in to MX when I use Gateron switch.

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(keys.switch-type=mx-snap-in)-BOTTOM_DIST_200-cmp.png]]
   [[file:images/mx-snap-in_vs_mx.png]]

   Alps vs "Box and MX"

   Key hole size is different

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(keys.switch-type=alps)-BOTTOM_DIST_200-cmp.png]]

   Choc vs "Box and MX"

   The switch hole wall is thinner.
   Added in Sep 2020 https://github.com/ibnuda/dactyl-keyboard/issues/50 and some fixes later

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(keys.switch-type=choc)-BOTTOM_DIST_200-cmp.png]]

   Kailh vs "Box and MX"

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(keys.switch-type=kailh)-BOTTOM_DIST_200-cmp.png]]

   The two teeth of switch shell can be stuck in the notch.

   I only have one Kailh box white switch. This switch can be stuck neither very badly nor very well. Hot glue is unnecessary.
   Because the size of switch and 3D printed keyhole have allowance or tolerance, your case may be different from my test result.

   [[file:images/kailh-keyhole.jpg]]

   Cherry and Gateron MX switches can be plugged into Kailh key hole, but are much less firmly stuck than MX snap in.
   In my test to Gateron switches, there is a chance when I pull out the keycap, the switch is also pulled out, which breaks the soldering.
   Not a problem in the case of [[#hotswap-socket][hotswap]].

** Inner index finger's column
   "Use inner column (like ergodox)" vs Normal

   Two more keys on the left

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(keys.inner-column=ergodox)-TOP-cmp.png]]

   Without vs Normal

   The left most column is gone

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(keys.inner-column=without)-TOP-cmp.png]]

** Hide bottom pinky
   Yes vs No

   The bottom right key is disabled

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(keys.hide-last-pinky=yes)-TOP-cmp.png]]

* Curvature & Tenting

  PI radian is equal to 180 degree. PI/180 radian is equal to 1 degree.

** Column's curvature
   pi/6 (30°) vs pi/12 (15°)

   The curvature pi/6 of (index, middle, ring) finger's column, that is, column 1, 2, 3 and 4 is steeper

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(curve.column-curvature=pi_6)-DIAGONAL-cmp.png]]
   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(curve.column-curvature=pi_6)-RIGHT-cmp.png]] 

** Pinky's column curvature
   pi/6 (30°) vs pi/12 (15°)

   The curvature of pinky finger column, that is, column 5 and 6 is steeper

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(curve.pinky-column-curvature=pi_6)-DIAGONAL-cmp.png]]
   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(curve.pinky-column-curvature=pi_6)-RIGHT-cmp.png]] 

** Row's curvature
   pi/18 (10°) vs pi/36 (5°)

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(curve.row-curvature=pi_18)-DIAGONAL-cmp.png]]

** Center of the curvature for the column
   Index, middle, ring, pinky in order

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(curve.centercol)-DIAGONAL-cmp.png]]

** Tenting Angle
   pi/6 (30°) vs pi/15 (12°)

   Row tilt is larger

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(curve.tenting=6)-DIAGONAL-cmp.png]]

** Rotation around row axis
   pi/10 (18°) vs pi/180 (1°)

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(curve.rotate-x=pi_10)-DIAGONAL-cmp.png]]

   -pi/10 (-18°) vs pi/180 (1°)

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(curve.rotate-x=-pi_10)-DIAGONAL-cmp.png]]

   -pi/36 (-5°) vs pi/180 (1°)

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(curve.rotate-x=-pi_36)-DIAGONAL-cmp.png]]

* Connectors
** Internal connector RJ9 Mini USB
   [[https://youtu.be/Oloh3Yabu6I?t=240][4:00]] to 25:00 of Kevin Eckert's build log is a good reference.

   I don't try this and I am not sure the connector size is the same.
   TRRS Micro USB option is more recommended than this if you want internal connector.
   
   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-BACK_TOP.png]] 
   
   [[file:images/internal-connector-rj9.png]] 
   
** Internal connector TRRS Micro USB
   "internal connector TRRS Micro USB" vs "internal connector RJ9 Mini USB"

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(connector.type=trrs)-BACK_TOP-cmp.png]] 

   - A 3.5mm audio jack connector PJ-320B can be used in the TRRS hole of case
   - A micro USB breakout board can be used in the USB rectangle hole of case
   - The pro micro board can be hung on the L hook (also called pro micro holder)
   - The pro micro board is connected to the USB breakout board with a cable
     
   This looks more complicated than external holder,
   but it's fine to use internal holder in the secondary part (typically the right part),
   because the secondary part is connected to the master part with an audio cable and no USB is required.
   
   [[file:images/internal-connector-trrs.png]] 

   micro USB breakout board
   
   [[file:images/microusb-breakout-board.png]]

   [[file:images/microusb-breakout-board-cable-case.jpg]]

   [[file:images/microusb-breakout-board-cable-case-glue.jpg]]

   Below image comes from [[https://www.beekeeb.com/dactyl-manuform-mini-mechanical-keyboard-build-log/][Leo's build log]].

   [[file:images/leo-dactyl-manuform-bottom.png]] 

   The position of the L hook (also called pro micro holder) is not calculated correctly in some case. Check it carefully.
   For example with the default dactyl manuform parameters, the L hook is separated from keyboard case.

   [[file:images/separated-promicro-holder.png]]

   Either consider [[#external-holder][external holder]] or follow below steps to change the position.
   1. click openscad menu ~window~ -> ~editor~ to open code editor
   2. right click the L hook (pro micro holder), click the ~cube~ to jump to the code
      [[file:images/pro-micro-holder-code-location.png]]
   3. the L hook is a [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/CSG_Modelling#difference][difference]] of a big cube and a small cube
      #+begin_src
      difference () {
        translate ([-94.9015632882982, 24.40298907331629, 16.208123960789713]) {
          cube ([6, 12, 12], center=true);
        }
        translate ([-95.9015632882982, 23.40298907331629, 16.208123960789713]) {
          cube ([4, 10, 12], center=true);
        }
      }
      #+end_src

      #+ATTR_HTML: :width 100
      [[file:images/pro-micro-holder-difference.png]]

   4. wrap the ~difference()~ statement with a ~translate([x, y, z])~ statement, for example
      #+begin_src
      translate([-1, -2, 3]){
        difference () {
          translate ([-94.9015632882982, 24.40298907331629, 16.208123960789713]) {
            cube ([6, 12, 12], center=true);
          }
          translate ([-95.9015632882982, 23.40298907331629, 16.208123960789713]) {
            cube ([4, 10, 12], center=true);
          }
        }
      }
      #+end_src
      moves the L hook (pro micro holder) 1mm to the left, 2mm back, 3mm up

** Internal connector none
   "internal none" vs "internal RJ9 Mini USB"

   This is used for wireless keyboard using non-chargeable batteries or wireless charging.
   If use wired chargeable batteries, no hole to plug the USB cable for charging.

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(connector.type=none)-BACK_TOP-cmp.png]] 

** External Holder

   Yes vs "internal RJ9 Mini USB"

   [[file:manuform/manuform-4x6+6-(connector.external=yes)-BACK_TOP-cmp.png]]

   [[file:images/external-holder-top.jpg]]
   [[file:images/external-holder-back.jpg]]
   [[file:images/external-holder-left.jpg]]

   The case back wall thickness is about 5mm, if [[#wall-thickness][wall thickness]] is 3mm by default, which is too thick for promicro v1 and v2 holder.
   The promicro v3 holder fits the case even though not 100% well-fitting.
   There is a [[https://github.com/ibnuda/dactyl-keyboard/issues/85][separated part]] in v3 holder model.
   [[file:stl/][Here]] is the fixed version for right case and a mirror version for left case.
   The 3.5mm audio jack connector PJ-320B and pro micro board fit the holder.

   It is highly recommended to set connector to ~none~,
   otherwise the hole may not be cut correctly and prevent the external holder from plugging.
   A [[https://github.com/ibnuda/dactyl-keyboard/pull/99][pull request]] is created but no response from author.

   [[file:images/remove-internal-holder-from-external-holder.png]]

   There is pro micro type-c version which is 2mm longer than micro USB version.

   [[file:images/pro-micro-size-comparison.jpg]]

   I made a type-c compatible holder by lengthening 2mm and enlarging the USB hole.
   Notice that it is untested. [[file:stl/promicro-holder-typec-untested-left.stl][left model]] and [[file:stl/promicro-holder-typec-untested-right.stl][right]].

* Known Issues
  1. Custom thumb cluster

     This function is experimental and only top 3 thumb keys (take right thumb
     cluster for example, top right, top left, middle left) are customizable. See
     this [[https://github.com/ibnuda/dactyl-keyboard/issues/28][dactyl generator issue]] for an example.
     The demo to these parameters is skipped.
